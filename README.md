# Indoor Climbing
Suunto App Indoor Climbing Beta Version

This app is designed to show the meters climbed on each Ascent/Descent or route for climbing without gps(Indoor Climbing). It shows the time spent in the ascent, the ascent and descent time, the meters climbed and the number of attempts/runs. Saves in the SA the number of times we completed ascent and descent in a training. And it generates a lap every time you finish the run or ascent/descent.

## To be improve:
  - Change the name of the variable used to store the number of indoor climbing accents in the SA.
  - Add a second condition to count the number of ascents/descents, use for example if the descent time is not increased for a few seconds. 

## I will Try to do it if possible:
  - Add an inclination data , and if is posible save the inclination dada for each lap.
  - 15 different grading scales : https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/rock-climbing-grades/
