Suunto App Indoor Climbing Beta Version

To be improve : 
  - Add a second condition to count the number of ascents/descents, use for example if the descent time is not increased for a few seconds. 
  - The display of the Ascended Meters screen, since I get decimal places
  - Using the correct icons on the screen 
  - Add an inclination data , and if is posible save the inclination dada for each lap
