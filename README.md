# Indoor Climbing
Suunto App Indoor Climbing 1.0 Version

This app is designed to show the meters climbed on each Ascent&Descent or climbing route without gps(Indoor Climbing). It shows the time spent on the ascent, the time spent on Ascent&Descent, the meters climbed and the number of attempts/runs. Saves in the SA the number of times we completed Ascent&Descent in a training. Saves in SA Suunto Plus the time that you spend in Ascent and the time spend for each Ascent&Descent. Generates a lap every time you finish the route or ascent/descent ***(you can also force that you have finished the Ascent/Descent or route by pressing the lap button).***

Other point of view is that this application can be used for training running up and down stairs with GPS.

## To fix Assap:
  - Today 05/02/2024 I tested it in a rock climbing wall with low height, and the problem is that if it is less than 3 meters it does not count that height (see how to do it).
## I will Try to do it if possible:
  - 15 different grading scales : https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/rock-climbing-grades/
