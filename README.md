# Indoor Climbing
Suunto App Indoor Climbing Beta Version

This app is designed to show the meters climbed on each Ascent/Descent or route for climbing without gps(Indoor Climbing). It shows the time spent in the ascent, the ascent and descent time, the meters climbed and the number of attempts/runs. Saves in the SA the number of times we completed ascent and descent in a training. And it generates a lap every time you finish the run or ascent/descent.

## To be improve:
  - Add a second condition to count the number of ascents/descents, use for example if the descent time is not increased for a few seconds. 
  - The display of the Ascended Meters screen, since I get decimal places
  - Using the correct icons on the screen 
  - Add an inclination data , and if is posible save the inclination dada for each lap
